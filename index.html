<h1>Cabin Kings Reviews | Jeremy Bell Reviews | Franklin TN Cabin Project</h1>

<div class="summary">
<p>This page documents our direct experience with <strong>Cabin Kings LLC</strong>, including contractor <strong>Jeremy Bell</strong>, in connection with a fixed-price cabin construction project in Franklin, Tennessee. This statement is provided for homeowners researching Cabin Kings reviews or Jeremy Bell reviews before entering into a construction agreement.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Cabin Kings LLC Contract Summary</h2>

<p>Cabin Kings LLC (Jeremy Bell and Emily Bell) entered into a fixed-price contract totaling <strong>$239,300</strong> for full cabin construction, including framing, structural assembly, roofing, chimney construction, flooring installation, and related structural components.</p>

<ul>
<li>Required 50 percent of the contract price upfront before beginning work.</li>
<li>Over $119,000 paid prior to substantial construction.</li>
<li>Total payments exceeded $180,000 under milestone structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>After requesting additional funds beyond the contracted scope, Cabin Kings refused to complete previously paid items unless further payment was issued. When additional payment was declined pending completion of contracted work, Cabin Kings ceased work and left the project incomplete.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Major Incomplete Work at Time of Departure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chimney construction unfinished</li>
<li>Roofing incomplete</li>
<li>Flooring incomplete</li>
<li>Chinking incomplete</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Invoice #180 and Change Order Issues</h2>

<p>Cabin Kings presented Invoice #180 requesting additional charges. No written change orders were executed authorizing these expenses.</p>

<p>Requests were made for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receipts</li>
<li>Supplier invoices</li>
<li>Cost breakdown documentation</li>
<li>Written authorization for additional charges</li>
</ul>

<p>No supporting documentation was provided as requested.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Structural Deficiencies Documented After Cabin Kings Left</h2>

<p>After Cabin Kings ceased work, structural misalignment was documented using levels and measurements. Multiple beams and vertical supports were visibly out of plumb. Framing components were offset and uneven. Gaps between structural members were recorded.</p>

<p>Licensed independent contractors later inspected the structure and confirmed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improper framing installation</li>
<li>Structural alignment deficiencies</li>
<li>Compromised stability</li>
<li>Serious workmanship concerns</li>
</ul>

<p>Corrective work required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full roof removal</li>
<li>Repositioning of structure</li>
<li>Installation of steel reinforcement beams</li>
<li>Roof reinstallation</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional contractors advised that full dismantling and rebuilding may be required to meet acceptable construction standards.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Licensing Verification – Jeremy Bell</h2>

<p>Verification indicated Jeremy Bell was not a licensed contractor at the time construction occurred. This raised regulatory and compliance concerns related to contractor licensing requirements in Tennessee.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Vendor Invoice Reassignment Issue</h2>

<p>A vendor invoice addressed to Cabin Kings LLC was later forwarded and implied to be the homeowner’s responsibility. No written change order authorized this expense, and no contractual basis was provided supporting reassignment of the debt.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
<h2>Lack of Financial Reconciliation</h2>
